next for JavaScript

# Installing

```bash
$ npm install next-loop
```

# Getting starter

```js

let Next = require( 'next-loop' )
let next = new Next() // you can pass a object to next constructor
// that will be used or passed as thisArg to every function.
```
# Usage

Create

```js
let count = 0
//the function are called with a arg and next, what is the next function
let fun1 = function* ( arg, next ) {
  // every function is evaluated with the arguments
  // passed when the event was emitted and the last
  // param is the next function in the array listener
  // or handler event.
  count++
  let res = next( 3 * arg )
  return res
}

let fun2 = function* ( arg ) {
  // the last function in the array receive the
  // next function that exec again  the first function in the array
  count++
  let res
  count++
  if ( arg < 100 ) {
    res = next( 2 * arg )
  } else {
    res = arg
  }
  return res
}
next.on( 'test', fun1, fun2 ) // returns itself, you can pass as many functions as you need queue
next.emit( 'test',4).then(function (res) {
  assert.equal( res, 432 )
}) // return a promise that is resolved when every function is finish
assert.equal( count,6 )
// count is equal to function number
// the emitter property is a EventEmitter instance self,
// where every method and property affect to Next instance too.
// Also can use once method exposed to Next to use functions wrapper
// with co.
```
### `Class Next-loop`
#### `Next([thisArg])`
To instance the next you can pass a thisArg object what will be passed to every function as thisArg.

### `Instance Next-loop`
#### `next.on(String,Function[,Function...])`
This method added the Functions passed to event Handler of event given(String). Returns itself.

#### `next.once(String,Function[,Function...])`
This method added the Functions passed to event Handler of event given(String) to be emitted only one time. Returns itself.

#### `next.emit(String,Object[,Object...])`
This method emit the event event given(String) and pass every Object argument to every constructor. Returns a promise that is resolved when the every function of event is finished or rejected if a error happen. If a error is through the error event is emitted or if a listener is not found the event "NotListener" also is through and the promise is resolved with the arguments passed when the event was emitted.

#### `next.emitter`
Instance of EventEmitter, every change here affect to next instance.

#### `next.events`
Object where the keys are the events added and values are arrays with the listers functions to every event.

#### `next.ctx`
thisArg passed to every function, this is the same passed to constructor and can be
upgraded at any time.
